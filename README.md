# Minefest
A mining game where you play against robots in a game of wits and economy management. 


# How to Play

## Basics

You automatically mine gold over time. Each round lasts 30 seconds and at the end of each round, players are ranked by how much gold they've donated. The lower-ranked players take damage based on their position (1st place takes no damage, 2nd takes 1 damage, etc.) The game ends when you run out of health or after 10 rounds.

## Controls

- Use your mouse to click on buttons in the interface
- Upgrade your pickaxe to mine faster
- Upgrade your mine to get more gold per mining operation
- Donate gold to win rounds and avoid taking damage



# To-do:

- Pet companion
- Random events
- Increase difficulty (currently the bots aren't as complex as I'd like them to be)
- Artifact shopping
- Roguelite elements should be added next in order to curb difficulty -> progression
- Multiplayer
- Tests to verify certain edge cases more robustly


# Cheat Codes (For Testing)
